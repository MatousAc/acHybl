The point of these notes is to correctly date (and assign myself an age) at certain events.

### My parents find out I am attracted to guys
It happened about late April/early May, before the 8th grader's class trip.
I went to the therapist starting in late April or very early May. I know this because I missed school *at least three times* on Tuesdays @ 10am. It lasted through June (past my birthday I believe). This places my weekly visits between 5 and 9 total before I got to quit. I quit officially @ a pre or mid summer retreat for canvassers.

In backwards chronological order by age:
* **15-16**
  * By 15-16 I was canvassing in Knoxville over the summer. 
  * So this happened before I was 15 for certain.
* **14-15**
  * I worked at the Herb and Plow Organic farm. 
  * Event is prior to this I think.
  * I have many emails of conversations with B that date to June-November 2014 with events that I remember happening after I was found out.
  * B was a freshman @ Heritage the year after, which made me an 8th-grader. This places me in 7th grade (13-14).
  * Still, I can't rule out the possibility that the event was here when I was 14. This is in 8th grade and corroborates one memory from class trip.
* **13-14**
  * I had my 14th birthday in Czech for certain. 
  * I think we arrived in late May/early June. The event definitely occurred prior to this because I remember keeping secret from my grandparents. 
  * It may have possibly been earlier in April/May, but this somewhat conflicts with a summer retreat in Cohutta when I clearly remember officially stopping therapy. This conflicts with being in Czech at that time. I think.
* **12-13**
  * So when I was 12-13 I was in 6th grade. 
  * I had had sexual activity with B the night I turned 12 @ Myrtle Beach.
