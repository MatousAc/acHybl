2. a publicity stunt
3. an attack in any way on any individual
4. a sob story
5. theological debate

## Why?:
1. God's leading
2. To be helpful/relatable to others who are where I once was
3. to combat the shame around this topic

4. therapy for sexual orientation
5. suicidal ideation
6. extreme self-disgust
7. depression
