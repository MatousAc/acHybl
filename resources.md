### recommended reads
* **Single Gay Christian**  
	Gregory Coles | ★★★★✭  
	*About*: Greg's testimony growing up gay and Christian. Shows the emotional and logical development of a boy in the twenty-first century church that finds himself undeniably liking other guys. Shows how he found joy in life through his unique struggle and calling.  
	*Theological Perspective*: The Bible prohibits gay relationships, but does not condemn those who long for them. If anything, these individuals may find themselves called to a unique and worthy position in Christ's church.  
	*My Opinion*: The most down-to-earth and relatable story I've ever read. Doesn't force any specific theology as it's main point. 
* **Still Time To Care**  
	Greg Johnson | ★★★★★  
	*About*: the history of how the church has handled its gay members. From caring for them back in CS Lewis's day to trying to cure them during the ex-gay movement, Johnson accounts the evangelical church's mindset and actions.  
	*Theological Perspective*: Being same-sex attracted/gay is not a sin and neither is identifying it. Acting on those attractions is sinful, but no more than other sin. The evangelical church has as much to repent for with regards to how it has treated the queer community as the community has for its sexual immorality.  
	*My Opinion*: I like this book because it contains a lot of historical information important to understanding the church's current mindset. It also seems to have a mostly unbiased voice when analyzing the history.
* **People To Be Loved**
	Preston Sprinkle | ★★★★✭  
	*About*: The theological argument surrounding gay marriage. Preston openly explores what the Bible, its authors, and its context say about God's intent for marriage. After finding more support for a non-affirming viewpoint, he answers questions for how churches and Christians ought to treat and care for queer individuals.    
	*Theological Perspective*: Being same-sex attracted is not a morally culpable sin in and of itself and calling one's self gay is more of a personal matter. One should explain what they mean by "I am gay." Acting on those attractions is sinful, but no more than other sin. In fact, the Bible has a lot more to say about other things that are often swept under the rug, such as greed.  
	*My Opinion*: I expected this book to be more about how to love the queer community, and less about the theology, but it was a great discussion. I think Preston is one of few who approaches the Bible ready to follow wherever his study leads. I would definitely recommend this to all my non-affirming friends, as well as more affirming friends looking for a good argument from another perspective.  
* **Torn**  
	Justin Lee | ★★★★☆  
	*About*: Justin's story of growing up gay and Christian. Being deeply spiritual, Justin suddenly finds his sexuality and faith at odds. Justin learns to be more gracious on the journey to an affirming view of gay marriage in scripture.  
	*Theological Perspective*: Gay marriage fulfills the primary purpose of marriage equally well. The church needs to work on its homophobia and learn to treat the queer community with the dignity it deserves.    
	*My Opinion*: Very relatable and not written to convince anyone of any particular theology. I like how it encourages discussion and brings up some points that evangelical Christians tend to avoid talking about.
* **No Longer Strangers**  
	Gregory Coles | ★★★✭☆  
	*About*: Belonging. Coles explains that similarity does not produce the best type of belonging and marriage is not the solution to loneliness. He tells of his journey to find belonging as a celibate gay man in a marriage-obsessed church culture.  
	*Theological Perspective*: Being gay is not sinful withing itself. As a gay person I feel called to lifelong celibacy which entails being joined to Jesus in the present.
* **Messy Grace**  
	Caleb Kaltenbach | ★★★☆☆  
	*About*: Caleb's story of being raised by two lesbian women. An unusual tale of prejudice against Christians and eventual conversion. Continues with a unique discussion on how to love, think about, and approach gay people outside the church or within it.
	*Theological Perspective*: Though homosexuality is not God's plan for any individual, it is something affecting real people all around us. Christians have a bad reputation and could do a better job at addressing this issue. There is a balance to be found between truth and grace. Sometimes things can get messy in the process, and that's okay.  
	*My Opinion*: Pretty decent. I thought it was incredibly unique and gave even me a message of hope for the church I am a part of.


### insightful
* **Homosexuality and the Christian**
  	Mark A Yarhouse | ★★✭☆☆  
	*About*: What are the different aspects and expressions of one's same-sex-attractedness? This book suggests a framework and gives advice to individuals in all types of situations surrounding the queer community. From mixed-orientation marriage, to healthy responses to young or adult children coming out, Yarhouse attempts to give solid advice based on experience and research.  
	*Theological Perspective*: Homosexuality and gay identity are not part of God's design and should not be supported just as other sin should not be supported. Those struggling in these areas, however, need great support, and so do those around them.  
	*My Opinion*: This one surprised me by having relatively decent advice to parents and queer individuals coming from a traditional, non-affirming background. I do not really agree with Yarhouse's fundamental trichotomy of gay attraction, orientation, and identity. I feel like I fit outside of this and many others I know do too. There are some short passages in his book, however, that are truly troubling, such as claiming the same-sex attracted person cannot view another's viewpoint. Very offensive. Otherwise I'd give three full stars and possibly a little more.  
* **Washed & Waiting**  
	Wesley Hill | ★★★☆☆  
	*About*: What does honoring God with my sexuality look like if I'm gay? The daily struggles of being gay and celibate.  
	*Theological Perspective*: Same-sex attraction is not sin. Acting on it likely is and so I refrain from romantic relationships.    
	*My Opinion*: I like this because the message is directed towards queer people specifically and it actually deals with the details of what to expect as a celibate Christian. It does presuppose homosexuality is a sin, but that is to be expected even from the cover of the book.
* **Stranger at the gate: to be gay and Christian in America**  
	Mel White | ★★★☆☆  
	*About*: Mel's experience as a gay man in the twentieth century. Full of passion and unusual gay conversion therapy as Mel grows up, raises a family, and directs a piece of the evangelical world from behind the scenes. Eventually Mel can't resist his desires, divorces, and lives with a man.   
	*Theological Perspective*: The church has hammered in the message that homosexuality is evil not because it really is, but because it wanted a scapegoat to raise money off of. Everyone's sexuality is a holy gift from God.  
	*My Opinion*: One of the most captivating books on this topic that I have read. Mel describes pretty much his entire life. Due to the ideologies and treatment he endured, it is no wonder that he had to reject what his church preached on homosexuality.
* **Welcoming but not affirming**  
	Stanley J. Grenz | ★★★☆☆  
	*About*: A serious discussion about the meaning of the Bible, the morality of homosexuality, and it's relationship to the historic and current church. Grenz explores how our conclusions about this debate influence other parts of Christianity and the church and how to treat the issue and those caught in the midst of it.  
	*Theological Perspective*: The Bible provides conclusive evidence that defines marriage as requiring sexual "otherness." Gay unions fail to fulfill this and are not marriage. However, there are many things the church has irrationally gotten wrong especially concerning it's treatment of those people in the midst of the struggle.  
	*My Opinion*: I felt like this should have been titled "The Bible, the Church, and the Gay Christian" or something like that, because much more time is spent on the theological, moral, and historical argument than I expected. Despite some ideas about marriage and homosexuality that I don't see the logic for, the reason I gave this book three stars is that, for an old book, the author presents his argument in remarkable detail. There seems to be logic behind every important idea that at least proves the author has good reasons for believing what he believes, even if some of those logical threads are not agreeable to the reader. 
	
* **Love Into Light**  
	Peter Hubbard | ★★✭☆☆  
	*About*: How a pastor and church respond to their queer community. Why the traditional ethic on homosexuality is correct.  
	*Theological Perspective*: stay conservative but be filled with love for the queer community.   
	*My Opinion*: decent. It didn't really hurt to read but may be a good resource for pastors.
* **Gay Girl, Good God**  
	Jackie Hill Perry | ★★✭☆☆  
	*About*: Jackie's testimony about her relationship with her father and a younger self engaged in lesbian relationships. She details how God drew her out and connected her with people that could help her find what her heart was looking for. Eventually she meets a guy she actually sees herself being with and marries him. She ends by trying to provide theological resources/encouragement for those who struggle as she does.  
	*Theological Perspective*: Homosexuality is enticing but wrong. The gay identity is also a moral problem.  
	*My Opinion*: Although it was a pretty nice testimony, most of the book was written in such a poetic way it felt forced and distracting. Parts of her experience seem to be portrayed as general fact while other's experiences guide them towards different conclusions.  
* **Out of a Far Country**  
	Christopher Yuan | ★★☆☆☆  
	*About*: Christopher's testimony. Yuan grew up with Chinese values, but went to live on his own as a sexually active, gay man in Atlanta. He soon became a drug dealer - leading to his eventual arrest. Due to his newly Christian parents and time in prison, he accepts Jesus and leaves his previous lifestyle. Goes on to help others with their struggle with their sexuality.  
	*Theological Perspective*: Homosexuality and the gay identity are sins. They are to be avoided. Those who are same-sex attracted are called to a possibly lifelong period of celibacy.  
	*My Opinion*: Not bad. Definitely an interesting story. However, it's thoroughly not relatable and replete with presuppositions based on his individual experience. 


### other books I've read
* **That Kind Can Never Change, Can They?**  
	Ron Woolsey | ★★☆☆☆  
	*About*: Ron's testimony. Molested at four years old, Ron grows up same-sex attracted. He marries expecting his "issue" to go away, but his marriage soon ends in divorce. Bitterly, he walks into a new life with many boyfriends as an adult in the West. Many unsatisfying years later, Ron comes to Christ and leaves his current life behind. After a few years he marries a woman again and is delivered from his same-sex attraction.
	*Theological Perspective*: Homosexuality is sin, but God was plenty strong enough to deliver me from it.
	*My Opinion*: Good story but not terribly applicable to my own situation. Even less relatable. Writing style is amateur.
* **God and the Gay Christian**  
	Matthew Vines | ★★✭☆☆  
	*About*: theological argument favoring a Christian view affirming same-sex marriage. Goes through the six "clobber verses" that mention homosexuality and explains the misconceptions Christians have had about them over the centuries. 
	*Theological Perspective*: Sex difference is not part of what marriage is. The prohibitive laws do not apply to modern people. Verses on homosexuality are mistranslated and originally addressed gang rape, pederasty and other forms of inflicting status sexually.  
	*My Opinion*: Makes very good points. Overall unconvincing to me personally because Vine's fails to show how gay marriage fits God's design in creation. He only unclobbers the texts.
* **Same-Sex Partnerships?**  
	John Stott | ★★☆☆☆  
	*About*: This book specifically looks at the potential of what we would call gay marriage today. Stott looks at homosexual activity from a theological frame, makes his case for heterosexual marriage, and then rebuts arguments. He finishes with discussing AIDS and a response to homosexually-oriented people.  
	*Theological Perspective*: The Bible clearly teaches in many places that homosexuality is contrary to God's design. Heterosexual marriage is the ideal.  
	*My Opinion*: So things trouble me in this book. For instance, heterosexual marriage is quite elevated, theological arguments here and there don't add up (Sodom argument mainly), and suggesting that AIDS is God's judgement on the gay community is concerning. I also don't like how the author portrays singleness equal to loneliness, although this is a bit back an forth. For a 25-year-old book, though, there are a decent amount of non-homophobic ideas here.  
* **From the Pit to the Promise**  
  Chris Anthony Delaney | ★★☆☆☆  
	*About*: Details Delaney's traumatic childhood full of deception, family drama, and indifference that lead to a homosexual identity. After many failed relationships, Delaney meets God who begins to turn his life around. He continues to struggle for many years in a mixed-orientation marriage but emerges victorious over bipolar disorder and same-sex attraction through Jesus.  
	*Theological Perspective*: Same-sex attraction and a homosexual identity are sin-patterns that lead to behaviors which are detestable before God. Homosexuality should not be elevated above other sins. Homosexuality, as other struggles, is likely caused by demons (at least in this case).  
	*My Opinion*: Powerful testimony. Not very relatable. Somehow, I've always felt suspicious of homosexual exorcism, so this it kinda too borderline. Writing style is amateur.
* **Is God Anti-Gay?**  
	Sam Allberry | ★☆☆☆☆  
	*About*: Sam tries to answer several questions about homosexuality and God/the Bible. After saying God is not anti-gay, he leads with the basic biblical case against homosexual relationships and argues that everyone is guilty of sin. God loves everyone and cannot be anti-anyone.  
	*Theological Perspective*: Homosexuality is sin. This sin is not any less grave, but not worse either. However, it fundamentally alters the gospel and cannot be compromised. Having a gay identity is flawed because we should not identify with sin or anything other than Christ.  
	*My Opinion*: He starts out with Biblical teaching. The second chapter is full of traditional arguments over the six clobber passages that are somewhat lame, and sprinkled with logical falacies. I've read plenty of rebuttals to the types of arguments Sam makes. For a relatively recent book, this instantly feels unresearched, generic, and uninformative to me personally. The book is too short to have any sort of impact, and too shallow to be convincing in any direction.  
* **A Change of Affection**  
	Beckett Cook | ★☆☆☆☆  
	*About*: Cook's testimony. As a atheist gay man in LA, Beckett never imagined himself being a Christian. However, after encountering the unique love of Christ, Cook slowly leaves his Hollywood-perfect life behind. He continues to live as a celibate same-sex attracted man with a new identity in Christ.  
	*Theological Perspective*: Being gay is an identity that leads an individual on a path contrary to God's good plan. Homosexuality is sinful (in action or in description).  
	*My Opinion*: I won't invalidate the testimony. It's there. It's not relatable though and makes things look quite easy. Theologically also somewhat unclear. Writing style is not very engaging.
* **The same-sex controversy**  
	James r. white & Jeffry d. Niell | ☆☆☆☆☆  
	*About*: A traditional biblical case condemning homosexuality and homosexual people. Explains why Sodom and Leviticus are clear condemnations of homosexuality.  
	*Theological Perspective*: Gay anything sucks.  
	*My Opinion*: Kinda a trash read. Honestly the arguments made seemed biased.
* **Navigating the Storms of Contemporary Sexuality, Identity and Love**  
	Ron Woolsey | ★☆☆☆☆  
	*About*: Uses the analogy of flying a plane and going on journeys to mode a sense direction in sexual orientation. Explains that homosexuality is another abominable sin characterized by disease, caused by child molestation, and strategically planned by 1980s gay activists. Woolsey calls people to "reorient" themselves and takes a chapter to rebut dangerous teachings such as "sharing God's love and acceptance" and "not trying to change one's LGBT orientation."  
	*Theological Perspective*: Homosexuality is a sin. Gay identity is underlying sin. Homosexual orientation is a choice.  
	*Opinion*: Overall, I kinda see where Ron is coming from on some of these points, but the book really is a thorough disappointment. The title makes this sound like a resource to young queer individuals coming from a conservative background. However, the magazine does not provide encouragement, understanding, or any assurance that "it will all be okay in the end." Rather, Ron takes the time to dive into the gay agenda, vilifying the queer community. He takes time to suggest that if someone is not being actively sexually transformed, their conversion must not be genuine. He explains the Biblical case against same-sex relationships but barely mentions what life is left for a consistently queer person with these beliefs. Backed by enough research to sound plausible and packed with negative sentiment towards the authors past, I couldn't imagine a worse resource to give a young conservative Christian struggling to reconcile their sexuality and faith.
