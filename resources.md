* **No Longer Strangers**  
	Gregory Coles | ★★★✭☆  
	*About*: Belonging. Coles explains that similarity does not produce the best type of belonging and marriage is not the solution to loneliness. He tells of his journey to find belonging as a celibate gay man in a marriage-obsessed church culture.  
	*Theological Perspective*: Being gay is not sinful withing itself. As a gay person I feel called to lifelong celibacy which entails being joined to Jesus in the present.

### other books I've read
* **From the Pit to the Promise**  
  Chris Anthony Delaney | ★★☆☆☆  
	*About*: Details Delaney's traumatic childhood full of deception, family drama, and indifference that lead to a homosexual identity. After many failed relationships, Delaney meets God who begins to turn his life around. He continues to struggle for many years in a mixed-orientation marriage but emerges victorious over bipolar disorder and same-sex attraction through Jesus.  
	*Theological Perspective*: Same-sex attraction and a homosexual identity are sin-patterns that lead to behaviours which are detestable before God. Homosexuality should not be elevated above other sins. Homosexuality, as other struggles, is likely caused by demons (at least in this case).
	*Opinion*: Powerful testimony. Not very relatable. Somehow, I've always felt suspicious of homosexual exorcism, so this it kinda too borderline.
* **A Change of Affection**  
	Beckett Cook | ★☆☆☆☆  
	*About*: Cook's testimony. As a atheist gay man in LA, Beckett never imagined himself being a Christian. However, after encountering the unique love of Christ, Cook slowly leaves his Hollywood-perfect life behind. He continues to live as a celibate same-sex attracted man with a new identity in Christ.  
	*Theological Perspective*: Being gay is an identity that leads an individual on a path contrary to God's good plan. Homosexuality is sinful (in action or in description).
	*Opinion*: I won't invalidate the testimony. It's there. It's not relatable though and makes things look quite easy. Theologically also somewhat unclear.
* **That Kind Can Never Change, Can They?**  
	Ron Woolsey | ★★☆☆☆  
	*About*: Ron's testimony. Molested at four years old, Ron grows up same-sex attracted. He marries expecting his "issue" to go away, but his marriage soon ends in divorce. Bitterly, he walks into a new life with many boyfriends as an adult in the West. Many unsatisfying years later, Ron comes to Christ and leaves his current life behind. After a few years he marries a woman again and is delivered from his same-sex attraction.
	*Theological Perspective*: Homosexuality is sin, but God was plenty strong enough to deliver me from it.
	*Opinion*: Good story but not terribly applicable to my own situation. Even less relatable.
* **God and the Gay Christian**  
	Matthew Vines | ★✭☆☆☆  
	*About*: theological argument favouring a Christian view affirming same-sex marriage. Goes through the six "clobber verses" that mention homosexuality and explains the misconceptions Christians have had about them over the centuries. 
	*Theological Perspective*: Sex difference is not part of what marriage is. The prohibitive laws do not apply to modern people. Verses on homosexuality are mistranslated and originally addressed gang rape, pederasty and other forms of inflicting status sexually.  
	*Opinion*: Makes very good points. Overall unconvincing to me personally because Vine's fails to show how gay marriage fits God's design in creation. He only unclobbers the texts.
