It is
	well, I don't want to give everything away immediately, so I'll just say:
1. my story of a struggle with sexuality and finding God/peace
2. a way to confront the shame about this topic and struggle
Why?:
1. God's leading
2. To be helpful/relatable to others who are where I once was
3. to combat the shame around this topic lmk
4. To simplify a 3-hour conversation when I come out to another person


I know myself to be verbose, so although I feel like my experience could fill my own, little, probably poorly-written book, I'll try my best to be brief without taking away from the story 
Testimony:
In the dark
The summer I turned 7, my family moved to the United States from the Czech Republic. Just in case this country is news to you, it's a little nation, often called the "heart of Europe," that was rapidly embracing atheism following x years of communist rule. [At that point I knew we had been to America once before while my father was studying to be a literature evangelist at Wichita Hills College in Arkansas.] With no friends, a new school, and a foreign language to absorb, I became so disoriented the first day that I recall being afraid of stepping outside for fear of this new continent not having solid enough ground and cool enough air. Luckily, it took next to no time to adapt to the new environment and make friends with all the other "staff kids" at the self-supporting Adventist high school my father now worked at. 

Not much happened between the day my life was flown across the Atlantic and my next vivid memory less than a year later. I was quite excited when my grandma, by far my closest friend among extended family, decided to visit us. My parents went to Atlanta to meet her, and to spare me a lengthy trip that I was not yet prepared to handle (everything feels much closer in Czech), they left me with the neighbors. I was particularly close friends with a boy just a year my elder. Though he always seemed more rowdy than I, we really enjoyed "out-jumping" each other on his trampoline and forging new trails together. In many ways, I looked up to him.
At some point that weekend, his mom told him to clean his room up, so we started putting all the toys on the shelves (and probably more in the closet). It was when I was crawling down from the loft bed we shared that he motioned me over to his dresser. Suddenly, I froze as he proceeded to expose himself to me. I now know of stories where the boy in my shoes turned and ran the other way. Stories where, despite all the right intentions, the stronger took advantage of the weaker. I wish I could say that I, too, left that encounter trying to forget it (or, even better, ran to adults for help). Rather, I remember not initially understanding what I was seeing (I wouldn't claim to have been a bright child), and then becoming very curious after several hours. What was that?  I didn't know, but it turned out that when he presented the opportunity again, I was willing to take the risk to find out. I have no need to go into graphic detail, but while I was curious to experience something new,  there were things that he asked of me that I was thoroughly uncomfortable with. Sadly, with perfect hindsight, they clearly point to his own molestation in the past.
A little later, when his dad came into his room and asked us how we were doing, while my friend kept his resolve, I was immediately overwhelmed with guilt and blurted out how we were really doing. After what seemed like a several-hour long interrogation and lecture about "never doing something like that again," we were set loose to go play again. When my parents came to pick me up the next day, my mom confronted me about what the neighbors told her. After scolding me for hiding things from her and reminding me that Jesus was always watching, I spent the rest of my afternoon curled up on my bed praying, in shame, that Jesus would forgive me for what I had allowed myself to do.

For a long time, that day was not summoned to memory as I went to school and chased adventure into the forest surrounding our community. It's extremely hard to pinpoint a day or location where I first remember being different from other boys, but in retrospect I can see that by my tenth birthday party I wanted to be emotionally closer to my friends at my sleepover than they wanted to be to me. The story of how I realized I was attracted to boys is somewhat unconventional and counterintuitive. As a naive eleven-year-old who thought he knew the bible inside and out, I would pick fights with the LGBT community on social media. Of course, my arguments about homosexuality being a sin and God despising homosexuals were intellectually inferior to that of someone twice my age who knew how to use Google to find scientific papers. That phase didn't last long. During one night at a close friend's house (let's call him Luke), Brandon asked to borrow my iPod so he could show me something. While handing it back to me, I noticed "naked women" in the Google Images search bar, and I didn't need a second glance to be horrified at the results. I may have surprised him by shutting down that experience immediately, but I surprised myself more a few weeks later when I looked for pictures of naked guys in the same manner. Luckily, my parents confiscated my iPod after noticing that I was playing a video game on it one evening and I did not develop any sort of addiction at so young an age.

However, I quickly began to realize that I wanted deeper, more personal friendships with my male friends. While they swooned over the single girl in their class (I attended a very small private school) I found that I could not relate. Instead, I would listen and compare the feelings they had for the girls with the ones I felt for them. I was the odd boy out. Eventually, Brandon and my short venture into pornography opened the door to more experimentation. First I was asked to sext (well, okay, all I had was a gmail back then) and then to experiment with him physically. Soon, I didn't need to be encouraged every time and sometimes I would even be more the instigator than the obedient younger follower. 

Although I was definitely curious at this time, I was simultaneously quite unhappy about my feelings for guys. It didn't take me long to connect the dots from my feelings and rising hormones to a quick Google search that told me I was gay. Suddenly, I wasn't arguing with people on social media that the homosexuals belonged in hell. Mercifully, my hate speech that I couldn't personally trace and remove was eventually deleted along with all of Google's failed attempt at social media. Thus before I was 12, I was already well-aware of my orientation and entered into a mental conflict that would continue to haunt me for over a decade.

In the  closet
To understand what happened next, let me backtrack and explain the context of my experience. Some of my earliest memories clearly reflect a concepts that shaped my reality. In Czech, I remember noticing that as Christians, my family was in the minority among an atheistic population. Even more uniq hahahahahaue was our flavour of Christianity, Seventh-day Adventism. In the back of my mind I was always aware that I was a spiritual minority of minorities.
My parents both found Jesus and the church after the fall of communism in Czech and soon after, found each other. After receiving an Associates degree in Literature Evangelism at a tiny conservative school in Wichita Arkansas, my father worked in Czech for a few years before moving back  to the United States. This is where my story started, 

The events that followed 
Hopeless
Faithful










This is where I started my story. Due to the summer programs that my father organized for students, he tended to not be around during the times that I was at home from school the most. Thus, although I realized that I had caring parents, and was lucky to have both parents for that matter, I never had a deep relationship with my father. He was great at providing for our family and instilling good work ethic, productivity, and a healthy respect for God, but sometimes spending time with him seemed to be more centered around discipline and less around enjoying things together. This likely had as much to do with my view of the situation as it did with the actual regular events that occurred. 
The community around the school I lived at and our home church was also quite conservative. And I don't necessarily mean this in a bad way. There were many good things that came of the environment I grew up in. I spent much of my time outdoors. I was schooled in various basic aspects of Christian theology at a young age. The church I attended was so supportive of the elementary school I attended that many of my friends went there only because the church paid their tuition. One of the most touching moments engrained in my mind was the way the church came together after a fire left only a little hill and a concrete slab where my home used to be. Neighbors and church members brought together enough spare furniture and household items to fill the academy's gymnasium. I was blown away when I got to pick up new toys and pick out a new sofa for the living room in the house the school gave us as a replacement. However, this same environment proved quite detrimental to me in many avoidable ways.

After 10th birthday party . . .
I began to notice the guys in my class much more than the girls as early as fourth grade. I remember several of my classmates in particular who I developed feelings for without realizing that it was happening. I didn't resent myself for it. I had not yet had any indication that what I was experiencing wasn't the norm for boys my age.
