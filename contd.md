## **My Testimony**
***
### **What is this?**
It's not
1. representative of everyone else's experience
2. a guide on becoming straight
3. a publicity stunt
4. an attack in any way on any individual
5. a sob story
6. theological debate
7. a finished story

It is
	well, I don't want to give everything away immediately, so I'll just say:
1. my story of a struggle with sexuality and finding God/peace
2. a way to confront the shame and misconception about this topic

Why?:
1. God's leading
2. To be helpful/relatable to others who are where I once was
3. to combat the shame around this topic
4. To simplify a 3-hour conversation when I come out to another person

I know myself to be verbose, so although I feel like my experience could fill my own, little, probably poorly-written book, I'll try my best to be brief without taking away from the story. Also, I want to reiterate that I value transparency in my story above all else. I wouldn't want to exclude my blunders in my story just to make a more powerful testimony, because then the message is built on partial truths. This also applies when I talk about other's involvement in my life. I have done my best to give the full truth without pointing fingers at any individual (that is not protected by anonymity).
#### **Intro**
My parents both found Jesus and the church after the fall of communism in Czech and soon after, found each other. Just in case this country is news to you, all you need to know is that it's a little nation, often called the "heart of Europe," that was rapidly embracing atheism following *thirty* years of communist rule. This led my father to pursue an Associates degree in Literature Evangelism at a tiny, conservative school in Wichita Arkansas. Then our family moved back to the Czech Republic so that my father could spread God's message. 

Some of my earliest memories are from these few years I spent in Czech. To understand much of my story I ought to explain the context of my experience and my state of mind throughout my childhood. Some of my earliest memories clearly reflect concepts that shaped my reality. For example, In Czech, I remember noticing that as Christians, my family was in the minority among an atheistic population. Even more unique was our flavor of Christianity, Seventh-day Adventism. In the back of my mind I was always aware that I was a religious minority of minorities. I remember witnessing to my atheist friends from my hometown and being challenged by them, possibly at the direction of their parents, to explain difficult ideas in the Bible. These beliefs would often alienate me from others around me. I didn't notice it much at age five, but I'm sure it would have been more challenging if I had stayed in Czech for my whole childhood. 
Due to the increasing difficulty of evangelism in the atheistic country, and especially due to poor cooperation from the Adventist church, when my father found the opportunity to lead students in literature evangelism at a small conservative highschool in middle Tennessee, he decided to move again. Thus, the summer I turned 7, my family found ourselves saying goodbye to our friends and family again.  

My first impression of the United States was the midday heat of Atlanta Georgia right before my first day of school. Because I had no friends at my first school and still needed to absorb a foreign language, I became completely disoriented the first day that I recall being afraid of stepping outside for fear of this new continent not having solid enough ground and cool enough air. Luckily, it took next to no time to adapt to the new environment and make friends with all the other "staff kids" at the self-supporting Adventist high school my father now worked at. 
Due to the summer programs that my father organized for students, he tended to not be around during the times that I was at home from school the most. Thus, although I realized that I had caring parents, and was lucky to have both parents for that matter, I never had a deep relationship with my father. He was great at providing for our family and instilling good work ethic, productivity, and a healthy respect for God, but sometimes spending time with him seemed to be more centered around discipline and less around enjoying things together. I definitely have great memories of spending time with my father, but very few of them are from my first few years in the Tennessee.  
Besides the school I lived at, our home church was also quite conservative. And I don't necessarily mean this in a bad way. There were many good things that came of the environment I grew up in. I spent much of my time outdoors. I was schooled in various basic aspects of Christian theology at a young age. The church I attended was so supportive of the elementary school I attended that many of my friends went there only because the church paid their tuition. One of the most touching moments engrained in my mind was the way my "conservative school" came together after a fire left only a little hill and a concrete slab where my home used to be. Neighbors and church members brought together enough spare furniture and household items to fill the academy's gymnasium. I was blown away when I got to pick up new toys and pick out a new sofa for the living room in the house the school gave us as a replacement. However, this same environment proved quite detrimental to me in many avoidable ways.  

#### **Into the dark**
Not much happened between the day my life was flown across the Atlantic and my next vivid memory less than a year later. I was quite excited when my grandma, by far my closest friend among extended family, decided to visit us. My parents went to Atlanta to meet her, and to spare me a lengthy trip that I was not yet prepared to handle (everything feels much closer in Czech), they left me with the neighbors. I was particularly close friends with a boy just a year my elder. Though he always seemed more rowdy than I, we really enjoyed "out-jumping" each other on his trampoline and forging new trails together. In many ways, I looked up to him.
At some point that weekend, his mom told him to clean his room up, so we started putting all the toys on the shelves (and probably more in the closet). It was when I was crawling down from the loft bed we shared that he motioned me over to his dresser. Suddenly, I froze as he proceeded to expose himself to me. I now know of stories where the boy in my shoes turned and ran the other way. Stories where, despite all the right intentions, the stronger took advantage of the weaker. I wish I could say that I, too, left that encounter trying to forget it (or, even better, ran to adults for help). Rather, I remember not initially understanding what I was seeing (I wouldn't claim to have been a bright child), and then becoming very curious after several hours. What was that?  I didn't know, but it turned out that when he presented the opportunity again, I was willing to take the risk to find out. I have no need to go into graphic detail, but while I was curious to experience something new,  there were things that he asked of me that I was thoroughly uncomfortable with. Sadly, with perfect hindsight, they clearly point to his own molestation in the past.

A little later, when his dad came into his room and asked us how we were doing, while my friend kept his resolve, I was immediately overwhelmed with guilt and blurted out how we were really doing. After what seemed like a several-hour long interrogation and lecture about "never doing something like that again," we were set loose to go play again. When my parents came to pick me up the next day, my mom confronted me about what the neighbors told her. After getting scolded for hiding things from her and being reminded that Jesus was always watching, I spent the rest of my afternoon curled up on my bed praying, in shame, that Jesus would forgive me for what I had allowed myself be a part of.  

For a long time, that day was not summoned to memory as I went to school and chased adventure into the forest surrounding our community. It's extremely hard to pinpoint a day or location where I first remember being different from other boys, but in retrospect I can see that by my tenth birthday party I wanted to be emotionally closer to my friends at my sleepover than they wanted to be to me.  
I began to notice the guys in my class much more than the girls as early as fourth grade. I remember several of my classmates in particular who I developed feelings for without realizing that it was happening. I didn't resent myself for it. I had not yet had any indication that what I was experiencing wasn't the norm for boys my age. I wasn't thinking "I must be gay" back then. Rather, I believed I just wasn't cool enough, which was true to some degree. I wasn't as physical or aggressive as my peers.  
The story of how I realized I was attracted to boys is somewhat unconventional and counterintuitive. As a naive eleven-year-old who thought he knew the bible inside and out, I would pick fights with the LGBT community on social media. Of course, my arguments about homosexuality being a sin and God despising homosexuals were intellectually inferior to that of someone twice my age who knew how to use Google to find scientific papers. That phase didn't last long. During one night at a close friend's house (let's call him Luke), Luke asked to borrow my iPod so he could show me something. While handing it back to me, I noticed "naked women" in the Google Images search bar, and I didn't need a second glance to be horrified at the results. I may have surprised him by shutting down that experience immediately, but I surprised myself more a few weeks later when I looked for pictures of naked guys in the same manner. Luckily, my parents confiscated my iPod after noticing that I was playing a video game on it one evening and I did not develop any sort of addiction at so young an age.  

However, I quickly began to realize that I wanted deeper, more personal friendships with my male friends. While they swooned over the single girl in their grade level (I attended a very small private school) I found that I could not relate. Instead, I would listen and compare the feelings they had for the girls with the ones I felt for them. I was the odd boy out. Eventually, Luke and my short venture into pornography opened the door to more experimentation. First I was asked to sext (well, okay, all I had was a gmail back then) and then to experiment with him physically. Soon, I didn't need to be encouraged every time and sometimes I would even be more the instigator than the obedient younger follower.  

Although I was definitely curious at this time, I was simultaneously quite unhappy about my feelings for guys. It didn't take me long to connect the dots from my feelings and rising hormones to a quick Google search that told me I was gay. Suddenly, I wasn't arguing with people on social media that "the homosexuals" belonged in hell. Mercifully, whatever hate speech I couldn't personally find and remove was eventually deleted along with all of Google's failed attempt at social media. Thus before I was 12, I was already well-aware of my orientation and entered into a mental conflict that would continue to haunt me for over a decade.

#### **In the closet**
One summer evening after my new self-realization, I remember helping serve dinner and then carrying everyone's dirty dishes away. My sister joked "Ac is being so nice lately. He's must have, like, gotten a girl pregnant and is just being super nice before you guys find out about it." My parent's laughed while I cringed. I remember thinking *I wish I had feelings like that for a girl. It would be so much better than the feelings I am really experiencing.* In addition to beginning to have doubts about what my attraction to boys meant, I was beginning to feel more distant from my dad. Most of the things he seemed to enjoy doing, such as fixing cars and wrestling (father, please fill in something here, I don't think wrestling is the best example) I found no interest in. Instead, I was more likely to play with my sister's polly pockets or don a dress she gave me to amuse myself. This was completely unintentional from both sides, but it still had a lasting impact. Perhaps because my father never had much of a father figure in his life, he didn't know how to reach me himself. I wouldn't be left on uncertain ground with my father for long, however.

One evening my mom summoned me to my parent's bedroom. As soon as I saw my father's face, I knew I was in trouble. "What is this?" my father pointed to his laptop. He was looking at some of my more explicit emails with Luke. I stumbled over my words as guilt surrounded me. I can never recall getting any sort of sex-ed from my parents, but I knew enough from my environment to know that I wasn't supposed to talk dirty with friends, let alone sexually. My father pointed to more emails. Between my apologies and mental gymnastics to try to extricate myself from an incredibly uncomfortable situation, I claimed that it meant nothing and that they were just jokes or bad ideas between the two of us. I'm not sure if my parents were crying, but I know I was. It was emotional, but I didn't try too hard to hold it in since I hoped it would decrease my punishment (and to be clear my parents didn't dole out unreasonable punishment. I was probably grounded from the family computer for a month or something). I left scolding myself for being careless enough to engage in prohibited activities where my parents might see them. I aimed to be more careful next time.

Very soon, based on some of the things the Bible said about "homosexuals" and the general atmosphere about the topic at school, I began to descend into much self-doubt and mental conflict over the feelings I was having. My most vivid memory that shaped how I perceived the church viewed me happened around the seventh grade. The church membership comprised more elderly folks than a regular Adventist church due to a massive golfing community for retired individuals nearby. Thus, it likely comes as no surprise that conservative viewpoints were appreciated by most of the church body. One Sabbath I was working in the brand-new "sound booth" above the rest of the congregation when right before the Pastor began his message he announced, "Now, brothers and sisters, I've heard of other churches in California doing some dangerous things that contradict the word of God. You may have heard of churches that are opening their doors to homosexuals. I stand here today and I just wanted to say that we **are not** going to allow ourselves to follow in their footsteps! We are God's people. No homosexuals will be invited to **this** church!" The *Amen*s resounded. To his credit, I never recall a full "anti-homosexual sermon" from any of the pastors throughout my years at that church. However, the words spoken that morning, and a few other times from the pulpit, skewered my heart. I slumped down in my chair in front of several soundboards and trembled. Although the congregation appreciated my pastor's promise to not invite "those people" into his church, they failed to realize that **I** was already there.  

By the time I was thirteen it seemed like the anti-homosexual narrative was everywhere. Likely it wasn't that something in my environment had drastically changed, but that I became hyper-aware of anything that could provide information about the feelings I was experiencing. When my principal discussed with my teacher how he thought that homosexuals were just confused, I stopped to listen. When he theorized, "What they are feeling isn't love. They don't know what love is. I mean, how could they?" the listening stopped. A habit of self-derision and overthinking settled in it's place.
